        When I stare in your eyes
        You'll be there forever
            To watch our life (to watch our life together)
            You just like going to Heaven (my heart)
            Oh, where are you taking me? (oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
            I'm fallin', and, I'm drownin'
            But, you're takin' me

            One thousand on my feet
            Stacks spreaded on my seat
            Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)

            Rollie Pollie on my wrist
            Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' on FaceTime
            Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
            Emboldened by the bliss
            I was sworn in by a kiss
            Late from the country caters
            No peacemaker, I sweep up cases

            Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
            New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
            Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
            Cupid creep in, sleep with a Hummer

            Three time to get me T-T-T'd
            Still same phone, AT&T-T
            Still givin' news very vividly
            Beef in there, fuck a beef
            Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
            I need no beef, no cheese (yeah)
            Even when I eat, they cheat (yeah)
            Every time we meet, naive

            When I stare in your eyes
            You'll be there forever
            To watch our life (to watch out life together)
            You just like going to Heav- (my heart)

            One thousand on my feet
            Stacks spreaded on my seat
            Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)
            Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
            It's mad how I get so high
            It's mad how you get me by (by)

            Look in my eyes, tell me a tale
            Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
            Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
            Am I picture-perfect, or do I look fried?
            All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
            Tell you demise, I went to my side
            To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
            I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me

            If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
            The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me inspired (hah)
            Yeah, yeah
            That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
            I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
            I run it from miles, this shit wasn't luck
            They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
            A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
            They say they the ones when they make the errors

            Can't look in the mirror, that shit wild
            Stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
            No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
            We do it for streets, we do it for keeps, we do it for rights, got 52 weeks
            This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
            This shit is forever and infinity

            Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
            I take me beat and I turn to a beast
            Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
            Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
            Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
            Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
            And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
            Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
            If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink</pre>
